# TicketManagement
When it is easy to solve the problems through computer mode, then why to delay? 
Normally when we face any problems in an organisation, we will usually inform to the admin.
But sometimes it is not sure that problem will get solved immediately.
So here comes our implementation of ticket management mechanism.
Our basic idea was to run the manual system through web development.
Initally when the client raises a ticket regarding the problem, then manager will be able to see the that and forward that to the respective technician.
Then problem will solved by him and he will update the status saying that th problem is closed.
Our future plans for this is to even enable the user to upload the image regarding the problem.
We have used Eclipse IDE platform. 
Tools include: 
View - HTML, CSS, JSP, JavaScript, AngularJS 
Controller - JavaClasses(Business Objects, Data Access Objects, Plain Old Java Objects), 
Servlets Model - MySQL
